# GorillaLoader and GorillaInternal
An internal cheat and cheat loader for TF2


GorillaMaintainer released! It's an awesome maintainer, VAC-module bypass released!

GorillaInternal released! The menu and functions are working great.

The use of a Directx level 9.0 or higher is required since the menu is rendered on Directx9, so just type in -dxlevel 90 to the Team Fortress 2 launch options in Steam,
or higher, for an example if you'd want to use directx 9.8, type in -dxlevel 98.

--How to use
Just inject the DLL to Team Fortress 2 using the GorillaMaintainer.exe.
--How to open the menu
You can open(and close)the menu by pressing ins or F3 in-game.
