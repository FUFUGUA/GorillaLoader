# GorillaLoader and GorillaInternal
An internal cheat and cheat loader for TF2


GorillaMaintainer released! It's an awesome maintainer, VAC-module bypass released!

!! GORILLAINTERNAL DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE IN THE CURRENT RELEASE OF TEAM FORTRESS 2 AND I'M NOT WILLING TO UPDATE IT, BUT I THINK GORILLA MAINTAINER CAN STILL BE USED IN ORDER TO BYPASS THE VAC-MODULE OR JUST FOR INJECTING DLL'S(DYNAMIC LINK LIBRARIES) TO GAMES(IT HAS MANUAL MAP AND NATIVE INJECTION METHODS AVAILABLE. !!

GorillaInternal released! The menu and functions are working great.

The use of a Directx level 9.0 or higher is required since the menu is rendered on Directx9, so just type in -dxlevel 90 to the Team Fortress 2 launch options in Steam,
or higher, for an example if you'd want to use directx 9.8, type in -dxlevel 98.

--How to use
Just inject the DLL to Team Fortress 2 using the GorillaMaintainer.exe.
--How to open the menu
You can open(and close)the menu by pressing ins or F3 in-game.
