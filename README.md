# GorillaLoader and GorillaInternal
An internal cheat and cheat loader for TF2

LegitBot coming soon, implementing it to the same DLL and letting the user choose from if they want to use the legitBot, or the original one. Sorry for the wait on legitBot, I'm currently focusing more on making a better "maintainer" for the GorillaInternal, the maintainer will be somewhat like a loader with functions like: disabling VAC-module, injecting GorillaInternal.dll, making configs for GorillaInternal. Other functions coming in later releases if needed.


GorillaMaintainer released! It's an awesome maintainer, VAC-module bypass released!

GorillaInternal released! The menu and functions are working great.

The use of a Directx level 9.0 or higher is required, so just type in -dxlevel 90 to the Team Fortress 2 launch options in Steam,
or higher, for an example if you'd want to use directx 9.8, type in -dxlevel 98.

--How to use
Just inject the DLL to Team Fortress 2 using the GorillaLoader.exe, note that you need to have the discord-rpc-w32.dll in the same folder in order to use the GorillaLoader.exe, else it will crash. And you'll also need to have the GorillaInternal.dll in the same folder as the other files(GorillaLoader.exe, discord-rpc-w32.dll) if you want to inject using GorillaLoader.exe(which is the easiest way to inject the dll, it's literally just 1 press of left mouse button.

--How to open the menu
You can open(and close)the menu by pressing ins or F3 in-game.
